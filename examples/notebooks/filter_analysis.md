# Lowpass Filter Analysis

## Design

We design a 64-tap FIR lowpass filter with cutoff frequency $f_c = 3$ kHz
at sample rate $f_s = 16$ kHz using a Hamming window, then verify its
frequency response $H(e^{j\omega})$.

```rustlab
h = fir_lowpass(64, 3000, 16000, "hamming");
Hw = freqz(h, 512, 16000);
w = Hw(1,:);
H = Hw(2,:);
plot(w, 20*log10(abs(H)))
title("Magnitude Response (dB)")
xlabel("Frequency (Hz)")
ylabel("Magnitude (dB)")
grid on
```

The passband is flat and the stopband rejection is strong. The normalized
cutoff is $\omega_c = 2\pi f_c / f_s = 0.375\pi$ rad/sample.

## Impulse Response

The impulse response $h[n]$ of an FIR filter directly gives its coefficients:

```rustlab
stem(h)
title("Filter Impulse Response h[n]")
xlabel("Sample n")
ylabel("Amplitude")
grid on
```

The symmetric shape confirms this is a linear-phase Type I FIR filter,
guaranteeing constant group delay $\tau = (N-1)/2 = 31.5$ samples.

## Filtering a Noisy Signal

Now we test the filter on a noisy sinusoid. The input is:

$$x[n] = \sin(2\pi \cdot 0.1 \cdot n) + 0.5 \cdot w[n]$$

where $w[n]$ is white Gaussian noise. We apply the filter via convolution
$y = h * x$:

```rustlab
n = 0:255;
x = sin(2*pi*0.1*n) + 0.5*randn(256);
y = convolve(h, x);
subplot(2,1,1); plot(x); title("Input (noisy)"); grid on
subplot(2,1,2); plot(y(1:256)); title("Filtered Output"); grid on
```

The filter cleanly recovers the underlying sinusoid.
