# Contour Plots

`contour` and `contourf` turn a 2-D scalar field into level curves. They're
the natural tool for equipotentials, isobars, streamlines' level sets, and
anywhere you care about "where does $f(x, y) = c$?". Under `hold on` they
stack on top of `imagesc` heatmaps to produce the classic field-plus-
equipotentials diagram.

Both builtins emit Plotly `contour` traces in notebook / HTML output (exact
level curves, interactive hover) and marching-squares line segments in
SVG/PNG.

## A scalar field to play with

Start with the radial paraboloid $Z = x^2 + y^2$ on a 41×41 grid. Its level
sets are concentric circles — easy to eyeball for correctness.

```rustlab
clf
[X, Y] = meshgrid(linspace(-2, 2, 41), linspace(-2, 2, 41));
Z = X .^ 2 + Y .^ 2;
print(size(Z))     % → [41, 41]
```

## Line contours

`contour(X, Y, Z)` picks 10 auto-spaced round-number levels by default:

```rustlab
clf
contour(X, Y, Z)
title("contour(X, Y, Z) — 10 auto levels")
xlabel("x"); ylabel("y")
```

The auto level-placement rounds step size to `{1, 2, 2.5, 5} × 10^k` so
labels read cleanly — the same rule matplotlib and Octave use.

## Explicit levels and line colour

Supply a vector of levels to pin exactly where lines fall; add a
single-letter colour code for the line stroke:

```rustlab
clf
contour(X, Y, Z, [0.5, 1, 2, 4], "k")
title("Explicit levels in black")
xlabel("x"); ylabel("y")
```

The final string is interpreted as a colour when it matches one of
`"r", "g", "b", "c", "m", "y", "k", "w"` (or the full names); otherwise
it's treated as the subplot title. Modifier arguments can appear in any
order — `contour(X, Y, Z, "title", 12)` works too.

## Filled contours — `contourf`

`contourf` paints coloured bands between adjacent level curves. In
notebook / HTML output this uses Plotly's exact polygon-fill renderer
(`coloring="fill"`); in SVG / PNG output it falls back to a per-cell
discrete-band approximation:

```rustlab
clf
contourf(X, Y, Z, 12)
title("contourf with 12 colour bands")
xlabel("x"); ylabel("y")
```

## The canonical EM diagram: heatmap + equipotentials

Under `hold on`, contours *append* to the subplot's contour list instead
of replacing it, and they coexist with any heatmap. This is the standard
pattern for plotting equipotentials on a field-magnitude heatmap:

```rustlab
clf
hold on
imagesc(Z)
contour(X, Y, Z, 8, "k")
hold off
title("imagesc + contour overlay under hold on")
xlabel("x"); ylabel("y")
```

When both are present in a subplot, the chart bounds come from the
contour's `(X, Y)` and the heatmap cells auto-rescale to fit. That keeps
the overlay aligned and the axes meaningful.

## Stacking multiple contour layers

Multiple `contour` / `contourf` calls under one `hold on` stack on top of
each other — handy for drawing two sets of levels in different colours:

```rustlab
clf
hold on
contourf(X, Y, Z, 10)          % filled background
contour(X, Y, Z, [1, 2, 3], "k")  % three black rings on top
hold off
title("Filled background + black line contours")
xlabel("x"); ylabel("y")
```

## Complex / saddle shaped fields

Contour handles anything whose level sets are well-defined. A saddle
field $Z = x^2 - y^2$ produces hyperbolic contours:

```rustlab
clf
Zs = X .^ 2 - Y .^ 2;
contour(X, Y, Zs, 16)
title("Saddle: x² − y²")
xlabel("x"); ylabel("y")
```

Marching squares skips cells with NaN corners (so masked-out regions
don't corrupt neighbouring levels), and saddle-point ambiguity (code 5 /
code 10 cells) is resolved by the cell-centre value.

|--------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `contour(Z)`                                     | `None`   | X, Y default to `1..ncols`, `1..nrows`     |
| `contour(X, Y, Z)`                               | `None`   | 10 auto round-number levels                |
| `contour(X, Y, Z, nlevels)`                      | `None`   | scalar: explicit level count               |
| `contour(X, Y, Z, levels)`                       | `None`   | vector: explicit level values              |
| `contour(X, Y, Z, …, "k")`                       | `None`   | string colour code (k/r/g/b/c/m/y/w)       |
| `contour(X, Y, Z, …, "title")`                   | `None`   | string title (anything not a colour)       |
| `contourf(…)`                                    | `None`   | same argument forms; colour arg unused     |

Each axis must have length ≥ 2. Complex inputs are compared by magnitude
(same convention as `imagesc`). Under `hold off` (the default), each call
clears the subplot's contour list before adding the new layer; under
`hold on` they append.

Terminal output does not render contours — a one-time warning fires, and
the advice is to `savefig("plot.html")` or `savefig("plot.svg")` to view
the figure.
