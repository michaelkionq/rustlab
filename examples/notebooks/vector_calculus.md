# Vector Calculus on Uniform Grids

Numerical `gradient`, `divergence`, and `curl` on uniform 2-D and 3-D grids.
The kernels use 2nd-order central differences in the interior and 2nd-order
one-sided differences at the boundaries, so the output keeps the input
shape and stays accurate all the way to the edges. Complex inputs are
supported throughout — useful for frequency-domain electromagnetics.

## Grid convention

`F(i, j)` corresponds to the world-space point `(x = (j-1)·dx, y = (i-1)·dy)`
— rows index `y`, columns index `x`. This matches the convention used by
`meshgrid`, `imagesc`, `contour`, and the 3-D variants.

```rustlab
clf
[X, Y] = meshgrid(linspace(-2, 2, 41), linspace(-2, 2, 41));
print(size(X))     % → [41, 41]    rows = y, cols = x
```

## 2-D gradient — `[Fx, Fy] = gradient(F, dx, dy)`

The radial paraboloid $F(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$ has the analytic gradient
$\nabla F = (2x, 2y)$. Quadratic fields are reproduced exactly by the
2nd-order stencils, even at the boundary:

$$F(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \nabla F = (2x,\ 2y)$$

```rustlab
F = X .^ 2 + Y .^ 2;
[Fx, Fy] = gradient(F, 0.1, 0.1);

% Centre cell (x = y = 0): both components ≈ 0
print(Fx(21, 21))         % ≈ 0
print(Fy(21, 21))         % ≈ 0

% Top-right corner (x = y = 1): gradient ≈ (2, 2)
print(Fx(41, 41))         % ≈ 2
print(Fy(41, 41))         % ≈ 2
```

`gradient(F)` without `dx`, `dy` defaults both to 1. The result is a tuple
`[Fx, Fy]` you destructure with `[a, b] = ...`.

## 2-D divergence — `D = divergence(Fx, Fy, dx, dy)`

The radial outflow field $\vec F = (x, y)$ has divergence $\nabla \cdot \vec F = 2$
everywhere — easy to eyeball and exact under the stencil:

```rustlab
D = divergence(X, Y, 0.1, 0.1);
print(D(21, 21))          % ≈ 2 (interior)
print(D(1, 1))            % ≈ 2 (boundary one-sided is exact for linears)
```

## 2-D scalar curl — `Cz = curl(Fx, Fy, dx, dy)`

In two dimensions `curl` returns the *z*-component of $\nabla \times \vec F$.
Solid-body rotation $\vec F = (-y, x)$ has constant curl $2$:

```rustlab
Cz = curl(-Y, X, 0.1, 0.1);
print(Cz(21, 21))         % ≈ 2

% The radial field (x, y) is irrotational → curl = 0
Cz_rad = curl(X, Y, 0.1, 0.1);
print(Cz_rad(21, 21))     % ≈ 0
```

## Composition: $\nabla \cdot (\nabla V) = \nabla^2 V$

For $V = x^2 + y^2$ the Laplacian is $4$ everywhere — verifying the kernels
chain correctly:

```rustlab
[Vx, Vy] = gradient(F, 0.1, 0.1);
laplV = divergence(Vx, Vy, 0.1, 0.1);
print(laplV(21, 21))      % ≈ 4
```

## Visualising a gradient field

Pair `gradient` with `contour` and a `quiver`-style scatter to show
equipotentials beside the field they generate. Until `quiver` ships, a
`scatter` of arrow tail-points conveys the same density information:

```rustlab
clf
contour(X, Y, F, 12);
title("Equipotentials of x² + y²")
xlabel("x"); ylabel("y")
```

In notebook output the figure renders as an interactive Plotly contour
chart; the same call from `rustlab run` would also accept `savefig` to
write SVG/PNG.

## Complex-valued fields

Frequency-domain EM fields are routinely complex, and the kernels work on
complex inputs without any conversion:

```rustlab
Fc = exp(j * X);                          % spatial phase ramp
[Fxc, Fyc] = gradient(Fc, 0.1, 0.1);
print(Fxc(21, 21))                        % ≈ j·exp(0) = 0 + j
print(Fyc(21, 21))                        % ≈ 0
```

## 3-D gradient / divergence / curl

The 3-D variants operate on `Tensor3` inputs — same stencils, same
boundary handling, same defaults. Axis 0 is `y` (rows), axis 1 is `x`
(cols), axis 2 is `z` (pages); each axis must have length ≥ 3.

We need coordinate tensors. Without broadcasting between `Matrix` and
`Tensor3`, the most direct construction is to build per-page coordinate
matrices with `meshgrid` and stack them with `cat(3, ...)`:

```rustlab
nx3 = 5; ny3 = 5; nz3 = 5;
dx3 = 0.25; dy3 = 0.25; dz3 = 0.25;
xs3 = (0:nx3-1) * dx3;
ys3 = (0:ny3-1) * dy3;
zs3 = (0:nz3-1) * dz3;

[Xp, Yp] = meshgrid(xs3, ys3);

X3 = Xp;
Y3 = Yp;
Z3 = zs3(1) * ones(ny3, nx3);
for k = 2:nz3
  X3 = cat(3, X3, Xp);
  Y3 = cat(3, Y3, Yp);
  Z3 = cat(3, Z3, zs3(k) * ones(ny3, nx3));
end
print(size(X3))                            % → [5, 5, 5]
```

For $F = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ the analytic gradient is $(2x, 2y, 2z)$, the
divergence of $(x, y, z)$ is $3$, and the curl of solid rotation
$(-y, x, 0)$ is $(0, 0, 2)$:

```rustlab
F3 = X3 .^ 2 + Y3 .^ 2 + Z3 .^ 2;
[Fx3, Fy3, Fz3] = gradient3(F3, dx3, dy3, dz3);

% Centre cell (i=3, j=3, k=3): x = y = z = 0.5  →  ∇F = (1, 1, 1)
print(Fx3(3, 3, 3))                        % ≈ 1
print(Fy3(3, 3, 3))                        % ≈ 1
print(Fz3(3, 3, 3))                        % ≈ 1

D3 = divergence3(X3, Y3, Z3, dx3, dy3, dz3);
print(D3(3, 3, 3))                         % ≈ 3

Zero3 = zeros3(ny3, nx3, nz3);
[Cx3, Cy3, Cz3] = curl3(-Y3, X3, Zero3, dx3, dy3, dz3);
print(Cz3(3, 3, 3))                        % ≈ 2
```

Each axis must have length ≥ 3 (so the 2nd-order one-sided boundary
stencil has enough samples). All kernels accept complex inputs.
