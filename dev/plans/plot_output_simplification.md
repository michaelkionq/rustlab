# Plan: Simplify Plot Output Routing

**Status:** proposal  
**Related:** `dev/issues/notebook-tui-suppression.md`

---

## Problem

Plot output routing is scattered across thread-locals, auto-detection
heuristics, and per-figure overrides. The current system has these issues:

1. **Notebook workaround is fragile.** The notebook sets
   `FigureOutput::Html("")` at startup, but any `figure()` call in a code
   block calls `default_new_output()` which returns `Terminal`, overwriting
   the suppression. Plots leak to the TUI and block on keypress.

2. **`render_figure_terminal()` does too much.** It's named "terminal" but
   also routes to the viewer via `sync_viewer()`. Every plot builtin calls
   it, and it dispatches on a three-way enum internally.

3. **Output mode is per-figure but context is per-process.** The notebook
   binary should *never* render to a terminal, regardless of what
   `figure()` calls the user makes. But the mode is stored per-figure in
   `FigureStore`, so every new figure needs to be individually overridden.

4. **`viewer on`/`viewer off` is a language statement** (`StmtKind::Viewer`)
   that directly manipulates plot internals from the evaluator. The
   `figure("file.html")` form is a builtin function. The `report` system is
   a REPL command. Three different mechanisms control where output goes.

5. **`sync_figure_outputs()` is called separately from rendering.** After
   every plot command, builtins call `render_figure_terminal()` (which may
   route to viewer) *and then* `sync_figure_outputs()` (which may *also*
   route to viewer). The viewer path runs twice.

## Current Architecture

```
User calls plot(x, y)
  → builtin_plot()
    → push_xy_line()                          [mutates FIGURE thread-local]
    → render_figure_terminal()
        match current_figure_output():
          Terminal → ratatui TUI + wait_for_key()
          Html(_)  → return (no-op)
          Viewer   → sync_viewer()
    → sync_figure_outputs()
        match current_figure_output():
          Terminal → no-op
          Html(_)  → sync_html_file()
          Viewer   → sync_viewer()             ← called again!

User calls figure()
  → default_new_output()
      viewer_active()? → Viewer
      else             → Terminal              ← ignores notebook context

User calls figure("out.html")
  → figure_new_html("out.html")               [separate code path]

User types "viewer on"
  → StmtKind::Viewer { on: true }
    → connect_viewer()
    → set_current_figure_output(Viewer(id))    [language-level statement]
```

**Thread-locals involved:** `FIGURE`, `STORE` (FigureStore), `HTML_FIGURE_PATH`,
`VIEWER_CONN`, `ACTIVE_REPORT` — five separate thread-locals that must stay
in sync.

## Proposal: Process-level output context + single render dispatch

### Core idea

Introduce a **process-level output context** that overrides per-figure
defaults. The context is set once at startup by each binary and cannot be
overridden by user code (like `figure()`).

```rust
/// Set once at process startup. Determines where new figures route by default
/// and what rendering is allowed.
pub enum PlotContext {
    /// Interactive terminal (REPL, `rustlab run`). TUI rendering allowed.
    Terminal,
    /// Notebook batch rendering. No TUI, no viewer. Figures are captured
    /// as FigureState and rendered by the notebook itself.
    Notebook,
    /// Report generation. Like Notebook but driven from the REPL.
    Report,
}
```

### Changes by binary

| Binary | Sets context to | Effect |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| `rustlab` (REPL/run) | `Terminal` | Current behavior. `viewer on` can upgrade to viewer. |
| `rustlab-notebook` | `Notebook` | `default_new_output()` always returns `Html("")`. `render_figure_terminal()` is always a no-op. `figure()` never touches TUI. |
| (future `--batch` flag) | `Notebook` | Same suppression for headless `rustlab run`. |

### What changes in the code

**1. Add `PlotContext` and a thread-local to `rustlab-plot/src/figure.rs`:**

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq)]
pub enum PlotContext {
    Terminal,
    Notebook,
}

thread_local! {
    static PLOT_CONTEXT: Cell<PlotContext> = Cell::new(PlotContext::Terminal);
}

pub fn set_plot_context(ctx: PlotContext) { ... }
pub fn plot_context() -> PlotContext { ... }
```

**2. `default_new_output()` respects context:**

```rust
fn default_new_output() -> FigureOutput {
    if plot_context() == PlotContext::Notebook {
        return FigureOutput::Html(String::new());
    }
    #[cfg(feature = "viewer")]
    if viewer_active() {
        return FigureOutput::Viewer(allocate_viewer_fig_id());
    }
    FigureOutput::Terminal
}
```

This is the key fix — notebook context is *sticky*. No matter how many
times the user calls `figure()`, new figures always get `Html("")` in
notebook mode.

**3. `render_figure_terminal()` respects context:**

Add an early return at the top:

```rust
if plot_context() == PlotContext::Notebook {
    return Ok(());
}
```

This is belt-and-suspenders — `default_new_output()` already prevents
`Terminal` mode, but this catches edge cases where output was set manually.

**4. Notebook executor simplifies:**

```rust
pub fn execute_notebook(blocks: &[Block]) -> Vec<Rendered> {
    set_plot_context(PlotContext::Notebook);  // one line, sticky
    // ... rest unchanged, remove the set_current_figure_output() call
}
```

**5. `imagesc_terminal()` respects context:**

Same early return for `Notebook` context.

### What stays the same

- `viewer on` / `viewer off` keeps working as-is in `Terminal` context
- `figure("file.html")` keeps working (explicit HTML mode)
- `savefig()`, `savebar()`, etc. keep working (they bypass the output routing)
- `report start/save` keeps working
- Per-figure output modes still exist (for multi-figure HTML/viewer mixing)
- `FigureStore`, `FIGURE` thread-local, all series data — untouched

### What this does NOT do

This proposal is intentionally minimal. It fixes the notebook TUI leak
with a single new enum + thread-local and 3 guard checks. It does **not**:

- Merge `viewer on` with `figure()` (they serve different purposes)
- Refactor `render_figure_terminal()` into separate functions
- Remove `sync_figure_outputs()` duplication
- Change the report system
- Add a `--batch` flag to `rustlab run` (easy follow-up)

---

## Future simplifications (not in this PR)

These are ideas for further cleanup if the `PlotContext` approach proves
its value:

### A. Unify render dispatch

Replace the `render_figure_terminal()` + `sync_figure_outputs()` two-call
pattern with a single `render_current_figure()` that does the right thing:

```rust
pub fn render_current_figure() -> Result<(), PlotError> {
    match current_figure_output() {
        Terminal  => render_to_tui(),      // ratatui
        Html(p)   => sync_html_file(),     // plotly
        Viewer(v) => sync_viewer(),        // IPC
    }
}
```

Every builtin calls this once instead of calling `render_figure_terminal()`
and then `sync_figure_outputs()`. Eliminates the double viewer sync.

### B. `--batch` flag on `rustlab run`

```
rustlab run --batch script.r
```

Sets `PlotContext::Notebook` so scripts that `savefig()` to disk can run
without any TUI interaction. Useful for CI and automated pipelines.

### C. Collapse `report` into `viewer` concept

The `report start/save` REPL flow and `figure("file.html")` are both
"render to HTML" with slightly different collection models. They could
potentially share infrastructure, but the use cases are different enough
(interactive accumulation vs. explicit file targeting) that merging them
may not simplify things in practice.

## Test strategy

1. Existing 933 tests continue to pass (default context is `Terminal`)
2. Add unit test: `set_plot_context(Notebook)` → `default_new_output()` returns `Html("")`
3. Add unit test: in `Notebook` context, `figure_new()` does not return `Terminal` mode
4. Notebook integration: render a notebook with `figure()` + `plot()` calls, verify no TUI rendering and plots appear in HTML output
